### Hi there, I'm Lucas Notini ðŸ‘‹

## ðŸ’» About me:

I have passion for creating solutions for life problems since a young age. 

I use to say that if there's a solution to a problem, I will for sure find it :monocle_face:

I am currently familiar with the following coding languages:

- Javascript
- MQL5
- EasyLanguage
- Python
- CSS/HTML

I am also on my way to learn more about:

- JAVA
- Angular
- React
- NodeJS
- 
... and anything else that I need to use :grinning:
